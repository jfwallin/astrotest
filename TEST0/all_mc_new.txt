question=How did Copernicus' model explain the retrograde motions of the planets?
answer= Planets orbit in small circles called epicycles, and the epicycle is orbiting the Earth in a larger orbit called a deferent. This caused the planet to have a "looping" motion as seen from Earth.
answer= It is an illusion caused by the lunar tides pulling on the Earth and making planets appear to go backwards. It is the Earth that is briefly moving backwards.
answer= Planets do not have perfectly circular orbits, and when planets are unusually close to the Sun, they move backwards for a brief time.
answer= Planets orbit the Sun at different speeds. When an inner, faster-moving planet "passes" a slower outer one, the slower planet appears to move backwards.
